# Next.js Self Hosting Example

This repo shows how to deploy a Next.js app and a PostgreSQL database on a Linux Ubuntu server using Docker and Nginx. It showcases several key features of Next.js like caching, ISR, environment variables, and more.

> [!WARNING]  
> This repo is still under development.

## Prerequisites

1. Purchase a domain name
2. Purchase a Linux Ubuntu server (e.g. [droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets))
3. Create an `A` DNS record pointing to your server IPv4 address

## Deployment Instructions

1. **SSH into your server**:

   ```bash
   ssh root@your_server_ip
   ```

2. **Download and run the deployment script**:

   ```bash
   curl -o ~/deploy.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leerob/next-self-host/main/deploy.sh
   chmod +x ~/deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

### What the Script Does

1. Installs all the necessary packages for your server
1. Installs Docker, Docker Compose, and Nginx
1. Clones this repository
1. Generates an SSL certificate
1. Builds your Next.js application from the Dockerfile
1. Sets up Nginx as a reverse proxy and configures HTTPS
1. Creates a `.env` file with your Postgres database creds

Once the deployment completes, your Next.js app will be available at:

```
http://your-provided-domain.com
```

Both the Next.js app and PostgreSQL database will be up and running in Docker containers.

### Features Supported in This Demo

1. **Configuring Caching and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**:

   - Next.js uses [automatic caching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying#caching-and-isr) with ISR to cache pages and revalidate them in the background.
   - You can configure the cache location for persistent storage across containers in the Next.js app.

2. **Reading Environment Variables on Server Startup**:

   - Next.js supports reading both build-time and runtime environment variables. Server-side environment variables can be accessed using `process.env` in [getServerSideProps or App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying#environment-variables).

3. **Configuring next/image to Use a Custom Loader**:

   - The Next.js `next/image` component is fully supported in self-hosted environments. You can use a [custom image loader](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying#image-optimization) if needed for optimizing images on your preferred service.

4. **Using Middleware to Protect Routes**:

   - This demo allows you to set up [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying#middleware) to protect specific routes.

5. **Reading Both Server-Only and Client-Accessible Environment Variables**:
   - [Server-only variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying#environment-variables) can be accessed via `process.env`, and client-accessible environment variables (prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) are injected into the frontend JavaScript bundle.

### Running Locally

If you want to run this setup locally using Docker, you can follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t nextjs-docker .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 nextjs-docker
   ```

   This will make your Next.js app accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Using Docker Compose**:

   You can also use Docker Compose to run both the Next.js app and PostgreSQL:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This command will start both services and make your Next.js app available at `http://localhost:3000` with the PostgreSQL database running in the background.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues like "Internal Server Error" or Nginx returning a 502 Bad Gateway, follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check Nginx Logs**:

   - Nginx handles reverse proxying, and if it can't reach the application, it will log the issue. You can tail the Nginx logs to see any errors:
     ```bash
     sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
     ```
   - Look for `connect() failed (111: Connection refused)` or similar errors, which suggest that Nginx is unable to reach the application.

2. **Check Docker Logs**:

   - If Nginx is unable to connect to the application, verify if the application container is running correctly.
   - First, check the status of the Docker containers:
     ```bash
     docker-compose ps
     ```
   - If the web container isnâ€™t running, check the logs to see why it failed:
     ```bash
     docker-compose logs web
     ```

3. **Restart Containers and Nginx**:

   - If the containers or Nginx are not behaving as expected, restart them:
     - Restart Docker containers:
       ```bash
       docker-compose down
       docker-compose up -d
       ```
     - Restart Nginx:
       ```bash
       sudo systemctl restart nginx
       ```

4. **Check Application Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure the `.env` file is correctly set up with the right database credentials and environment variables. If any variables are missing or incorrect, the app might not start properly.
   - You can update the `.env` file located in the app directory and then rebuild the Docker containers.
